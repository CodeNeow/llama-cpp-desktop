// Measured RAM bandwidth calibration for the auto-tuner.
//
// The cpu-moe plan (MoE experts served from system RAM) decodes at a speed
// bounded by memory read bandwidth, yet the static tuner rules cannot tell a
// 12 GB/s single-channel DDR4 machine from a 60 GB/s dual-channel DDR5 one.
// This file measures the machine's real all-core streaming read bandwidth
// once, caches the result keyed by a hardware fingerprint
// (llama-desktop-benchcache.json, atomic write) and feeds it into
// tuneModelConfig as hw.RAMBandwidthGBs, where it gates exactly one
// preference flip: a cramped full-offload plan vs the cpu-moe plan (see
// autotune.go). Every failure path degrades to "unknown" (bandwidth 0),
// which keeps the tuner byte-for-byte on its static rules; the benchmark
// only ever costs a bounded ~1-2 s on the first tune click and never fails
// the tune.
//
// Design borrowed from FreeToken's moe/benchbw.py (philosophy only): measure
// with a real streaming kernel over a working set far larger than any
// last-level cache, keep the reduction alive to defeat dead-code
// elimination, and persist one profile per hardware identity, rejecting
// stale or cross-machine values on load.
